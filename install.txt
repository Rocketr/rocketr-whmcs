To install:

1. Upload the files from the upload directory to the respective locations. There should one rocketr.php file under /modules/gateways/ and another under /modules/gateways/callback/. Please note where you upload the file matters. DO NOT upload the /modules/gateways/callback/rocketr.php file to /modules/gateways/rocketr.php. Even though the names are the same, the files are different.

2. From your WHMCS admin panel > Go to Setup > Then Payments > Then Payment Gateways.

3. After typing your password in again (optional), click on All Payment Gateways. Click on Rocketr.net and make sure it is green.
